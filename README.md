## ðŸŽ® About the Game

**INFECTD** is a top-down 2D maze survival game set in a world overrun by zombies. Your mission?  
**Collect antidote elements, survive waves of zombies, and escape to the next level.**

Built using **Godot 4** with a beautiful GUI interface and custom HUDs, the game reflects intelligent game design, strong logic, and polished execution.  
It was created as a part of the *Programming in C++* module, with backend C++ structure mirrored in the repo to reflect programming proficiency.
